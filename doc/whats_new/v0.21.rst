Version 0.21.0
==============

**In development**

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- :class:`linear_model.BayesianRidge` (bug fix)

- please add class and reason here (see version 0.20 what's new)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

Support for Python 3.4 and below has been officially dropped.

    See version doc/whats_new/v0.20.rst for structure. Entries should be
    prefixed with one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|,
    |Enhancement|, |Fix| or |API|. They should be under a heading for the
    relevant module (or *Multiple Modules* or *Miscellaneous*), and within each
    section should be ordered according to the label ordering above. Entries
    should end with: :issue:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |MajorFeature| A new clustering algorithm: :class:`cluster.OPTICS`: an
  algoritm related to :class:`cluster.DBSCAN`, that has hyperparameters easier
  to set and that scales better, by :user:`Shane <espg>` and
  :user:`Adrin Jalali <adrinjalali>`.

:mod:`sklearn.linear_model`
...........................

- |Fix| Fixed the posterior mean, posterior covariance and returned
  regularization parameters in :class:`linear_model.BayesianRidge`. The
  posterior mean and the posterior covariance were not the ones computed
  with the last update of the regularization parameters and the returned
  regularization parameters were not the final ones. Also fixed the formula of
  the log marginal likelihood used to compute the score when
  `compute_score=True`. :issue:`10748` by
  :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Multiple modules

Changes to estimator checks
---------------------------

These changes mostly affect library developers.
